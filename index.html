            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer based in Myanmar, where I've been fortunate to witness the rapid growth of the tech industry. My journey in software development has taken me through a diverse set of technologies and experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have a strong foundation in the front end, with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've taken my web development skills to the next level with TypeScript and popular frameworks like React. Building responsive and intuitive user interfaces is not just a task for me; it's a creative process that I enjoy wholeheartedly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the back end, I'm well-versed in server-side technologies such as Node.js and Express.js, which allow me to craft robust and scalable applications. My proficiency in working with databases includes MongoDB, ensuring that data is managed efficiently and securely.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond web development, I have a versatile skill set that spans multiple programming languages, including Python, C/C++/C#, and Java. This diversity of skills enables me to approach problems from various angles and choose the right tool for the job.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But my journey doesn't stop at coding. Git is my trusty version control companion, helping me collaborate effectively with teams and manage codebase changes seamlessly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm not just a developer; I'm a problem solver. I'm passionate about using technology to address real-world challenges and create solutions that enhance people's lives. Clean and maintainable code is my hallmark, ensuring that projects remain flexible and scalable as they evolve.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a Fullstack Developer, I'm excited to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end technologies, turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. I'm always eager to take on new challenges, learn emerging technologies, and work with dynamic teams to bring innovative projects to life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let's embark on a journey of creativity, innovation, and web development excellence together. I'm here to make a meaningful impact through code and collaboration.
